# Fraction Data Type in Python




## Introduction
This project implements a custom Fraction data type in Python, enabling arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two fractions. It displays results in fractional form (e.g., 4/5).

## Key Features

- **Fraction Representation:** Fractions are displayed as numerator/denominator.


### Arithmetic Operations:
- **Addition:** Adds two fractions and returns the result in fractional form.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts two fractions and returns the result in fractional form.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two fractions and returns the result in fractional form.
- **Division:** Divides two fractions and returns the result in fractional form.
## Code Structures

- **class Fraction:** Custom class to represent and operate on fractions.


### Methods:
- __str__(): Returns the fraction as a string in the form numerator/denominator.
- __add__(): Adds two fractions.
- __sub__(): Subtracts two fractions.
- __mul__(): Multiplies two fractions.
- __truediv__(): Divides two fractions.
## Prerequisite

- Python 3.x installed on your system
## Usage

1. **Input Fractions:** The program prompts you to enter the numerator and denominator for two fractions.
2. **Perform Operations:** The program performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the entered fractions.
3. **View Results:** The results are displayed in fractional form.
## Example Prompts

- Enter the details for 1st fraction: 
- Enter the Nominator: 3
- Enter the Denominator: 4


- Enter the details for 2nd fraction: 
- Enter the Nominator: 2
- Enter the Denominator: 5

Your fraction_1 is: 3/4 &&
Your fraction_2 is: 2/5
1. Sum of the fractions is: 23/20
2. Subtraction of the fractions is: 7/20
3. Multiplication of the fractions is: 6/20
4. Division of the fractions is: 15/8


## Project Highlights

- **Custom Data Type:** Demonstrates creation and manipulation of a custom fraction data type.
- **Operator Overloading:** Uses __add__, __sub__, __mul__, and __truediv__ methods to overload operators and allow arithmetic operations.
- **User Input:** Simple interface for users to input fractions and view results.
